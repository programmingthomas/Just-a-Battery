#Just a Battery

An iOS app that will *literally* just show you how much battery you have remaining with no extraneous details.

##Why?
A quick search on the App Store for 'battery' reveals over 1500 apps, however they are all filled with things that users do not need:

* Ads
* In app purchases
* 'Uber Battery Doctor Master HD + retina 4000'
* Claims that they will improve your battery life
* Give incorrect advice ('secrets') to improving battery life
* How much usage you have left, which may be incorrect or irrelevant
* Take ages to load
* Haven't been updated for up to three or four years
* Are large (10 - 20MB) downloads despite simple feature set
* Have ridiculous animations and graphics to represent battery
* Have stupid names
* Have stupid icons
* 'Tweet my battery'

Ultimately, I have aimed to create an app far simpler than any other app already available in order to focus on what users actually care about: how much battery they have left.

##Why GPL?
* I can prove to people that the app literally does nothing except show them how much battery life they have
* It only took me about twenty minutes to make it
* I used the GPL license over other licenses because developers really shouldn't need to copy my code (it is so simple) and because if you fork it to try and extend it you clearly don't understand the goal of the project
